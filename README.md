# Slice Insights: Pizza Sales Report with SQL and Power BI

This project utilizes SQL and Power BI to analyze annual pizza sales data. It involves executing SQL queries to extract key performance indicators, identifying daily and monthly sales trends, and calculating sales percentages by category and size. Power BI is employed for data cleaning, visualization, and dashboard creation, including a detailed analysis of top and bottom-selling items.

## Getting Started

1. **Data Analysis with SQL**:
   - The initial analysis was performed using SQL. SQL scripts and queries used for data extraction, transformation, and loading are available in the [Queries.pdf](Queries.pdf) file.

2. **Creating Dashboards with Power BI**:
   - The Power BI project file [slice_insights.pbix](slice_insights.pbix) contains the interactive dashboards. Open and customize this file using Power BI Desktop.

3. **Access the Dashboard**:
   - Open the `slice_insights.pbix` file with Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive dashboards.

## Data Analysis with SQL

The SQL analysis involved extracting and transforming data related to pizza sales, categories, sizes, and various key performance indicators. The analysis includes:
   - Tracking daily and monthly sales trends and revenue generation.
   - Identifying top-selling pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and total orders.
   - Determining least-selling pizzas based on similar metrics.
   - Calculating sales percentages by pizza category and customer orders.

## Creating Dashboards with Power BI

Power BI is utilized to create interactive dashboards for visualizing pizza sales data. The Power BI project file (`slice_insights.pbix`) features the following dashboards:
